<p>
    First, create the stream you'd like to use for Jenkins or Hudson
    notifications, and subscribe all interested parties to this stream. We
    recommend the name <code>jenkins</code> or <code>hudson</code>.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Install the plugin</strong><br/> Install the "Zulip"
    plugin by going to
    <code>Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins > Available</code>,
    typing in "Zulip", and clicking "Install without
    restart". (For historical reasons, the plugin might be named
    "Humbug Plugin" in some places)
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Configure the plugin</strong><br/> Once the plugin
    is installed, configure it by going to
    <code>Manage Jenkins > Configure System</code>. Scroll to the
    section labeled "Zulip Notification Settings", and specify your
    bot's email address, API key, the stream receiving the
    notifications, and whether you'd like a notification on every
    build, or only when the build fails (Smart Notification).
</p>

<p>
    (If you don't see this option, you may first need to restart
    Jenkins.)

<p>
    <strong>Configure a post-build action for your project</strong><br/>
    Once you've done that, it's time to configure one of your
    projects to use the Zulip notification plugin. From your
    project page, click "Configure" on the left sidebar. Scroll to
    the bottom until you find the section labeled "Post-build
    Actions". Click the dropdown and select "Zulip
    Notification". It should look as below. Then click "Save".

<p>
    <b>Congratulations! You're done!</b><br/> When your builds
    fail or succeed, you'll see a commit message like the following
    with a topic that matches the project name (in this case
    "SecretProject"):

<p>
    <b>Troubleshooting</b><br/>
    <ul>
        <li>Did you set up a post-build action for your project?</li>
        <li>Does the stream you picked (e.g. <code>jenkins</code>) already exist? If not, add yourself to it and try
            again.
        </li>
        <li>Are your access key and email address correct? Test them using <a href="/api">our curl API</a>.</li>
        <li>Still stuck? Email <a
            href="mailto:zulip-devel@googlegroups.com?subject=Jenkins">zulip-devel@googlegroups.com</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
