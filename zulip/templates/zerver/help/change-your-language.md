# Change your language

By default, the Zulip UI is displayed in English.  However, Zulip has
full support for internationalization, and the UI has been translated
into many other languages.  You can see the Zulip UI in other
languages temporarily by modifying the URLs using the appropriate
language code, e.g. `/ru/` for Russian.

Additionally, you can change the default language in the Zulip UI for
your Zulip account using the following procedure.
