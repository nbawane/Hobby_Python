# Pin a stream

If you are subscribed to a lot of streams, pinning important streams to the top
of the **Streams** section on your left sidebar can be a good way to organize
streams.

## Pinning a stream using the left sidebar

If you want to quickly pin a single stream, you can do so through the stream sidebar.

{!stream-actions.md!}

2. Click on the {!down-chevron.md!} Select the **Pin stream (stream name) to top**
option from the actions dropdown.

3. Upon selecting the **Pin stream (stream name) to top** option, the selected
stream will be pinned the top of the **Streams** section, confirming the success
of your pinning.

### Pinning a stream using the [Streams](/#streams) page

If you want to pin multiple streams at once, you should pin streams through the [Streams](/#streams) page.

{!subscriptions.md!}
{!filter-streams.md!}

2. Select the stream you want to pin in the [Streams](/#streams) page; {!stream-settings.md!}

3. Select the **Pin stream to top of left sidebar** option in **Stream settings**.

4. Once you close the [Streams](/#streams) page, the selected stream
will be pinned the top of the **Streams** section, confirming the success of
your pinning.
