4. You now have access to your bot's API key and API
configuration file (`.zuliprc`) which you will need for integrations that you would like
to use with this bot. You can click on the download
(<i class="icon-vector-download-alt"></i>) icon to download your `.zuliprc` file.

## Add an integration

The [Integrations page](/integrations) offers a complete list of all the
integrations currently supported by Zulip. To add an integration to your
organization, select the integration that you would like to use from the list
and follow the installation instructions accordingly.
