# Change the date and time format

By default, messages in Zulip are displayed with a 12-hour timestamp
(e.g. 3:00 PM, not 15:00). If you prefer to see the time displayed in
a 24-hour format, you can do so easily using the following procedure:

{!go-to-the.md!} [Display settings](/#settings/display-settings)
{!settings.md!}

2. Select the option labeled **Display time in 24-hour format (17:00
   instead of 5:00 PM)**.
