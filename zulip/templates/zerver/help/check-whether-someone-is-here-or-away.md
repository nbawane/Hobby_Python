# Check whether someone is here or away

You can check a user's status, represented by little circles to the left of a
user’s name, in the user list located at the right sidebar by default.

 * A green circle
   (<span class="indicator green solid"></span>) means the
   user is “active” — the browser has determined that the Zulip page
   has “focus” at the moment on the user’s computer.

 * A white, circle (<span class="indicator grey"></span>) means the user is
   not active and was not recently so.

 * An orange half-filled circle
   (<span class="indicator orange"></span>)
   means the user is “not active” but was recently so.

!!! tip ""
    You can also view a user's status by hovering over their name in the user list.

 If you have messaged users in a group PM, their names will appear
 at the bottom of the right sidebar. In that case, a pale green circle (<span
 class="indicator green"></span>) means that some were recently active but
 currently inactive, while others' statuses are unknown. A regular green circle
 (<span class="indicator green solid"></span>) means all users in the group PM
 have been recently active.
