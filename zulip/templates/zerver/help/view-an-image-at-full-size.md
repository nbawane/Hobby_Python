# View an image at full size

When someone sends an image in a message, a thumbnail preview of the image
will be generated in the message if the image is a common image type (i.e.
PNG, JPEG, etc.).

![preview](/static/images/help/image-preview.png)

To view the image in full size, click on the thumbnail preview of the image.
Clicking it will open a lightbox modal with varying options depending on the
media type.

Images can be opened in new tabs by clicking the **Open** button at the top
right corner of the screen, but they also can be downloaded by clicking the
**Download** button.

    To exit out of the lightbox modal, click the x (<i
    class="icon-vector-remove"></i>) icon in the top right corner or press
    the escape key.
