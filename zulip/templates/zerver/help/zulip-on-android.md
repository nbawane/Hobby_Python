# Using Zulip on Android

Zulip has an Android application, compatible with Android versions 3.2 and
higher. The app can be downloaded from the
[Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zulip.android).

## Initial setup
### Connecting to a server

When you open the app for the first time or after you log out, a screen asking
for your server's address appears. You have to write the server's URL in it, and
press **Enter**.

!!! warn ""
    **Note:** There's no need to add `https://` in case your server is running a secure
    HTTP (HTTPS) protocol.

    However, if your server uses an insecure HTTP connection, you'll have to
    write `http://` manually. A message will appear, warning you about the risks
    of using this type of connections. In case you have no other choice, choose the
    **Use HTTP** option.

### Logging in

After connecting to the server, you'll be able to log in either with an email
address and a password, or using your Google account.

* If you decide to log in with an email/password combination, enter your email
address in the **Email** field and your password in the **Password** field,
then press **Log in**.

* If you prefer to log in with your Google account, press the **Sign in with Google** button.

    You will be asked to choose which one do you want to use from those you have
    configured in your device.

### Logging in (development servers)

The Android application supports connecting to development servers as well. To
do so, choose the **Dev backend testing server** option from the
**Authentication Options** menu, and select the account you want to use.

### Logging out

You only need to log out when you want to switch to another account or server.
To do so, tap the overflow ( <i class="icon-vector-ellipsis-vertical"></i> )
icon in the top right corner of the screen, and choose **Log out**.
