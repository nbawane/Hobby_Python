# Signing in

Zulip offers three ways to sign in: e-mail and password, Google
credentials, and GitHub credentials. Your organization's administrator
may choose to enable or disable any of these options. So don't worry
if your login page doesn't have some of the options described here!

## Signing in with your email address

You can sign into your Zulip organization using your email address by
following a few simple steps.

1. In the field labeled **Email**, enter the email address that you
   used to sign up for Zulip. Please note that the **Email** field is
   case-sensitive.

        If you've forgotten which email you used to sign up for
        Zulip, you can try searching your email accounts for the
        e-mail you received when you first signed up. The subject line
        is "Welcome to Zulip".

2. In the field labeled **Password**, enter your password. Please note
   that the **Password** field is case-sensitive.
