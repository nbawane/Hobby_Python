# Set notifications for a single stream

On Zulip, you can set different notification settings for different streams.

1. To set notifications for a single stream, find the **Streams**
 list located on the left sidebar.

2. On the **Streams** list, hover over the stream that you want to set
 notifications for to reveal a down chevron
 (<i class="icon-vector-chevron-down"></i>) icon.

3. Click on the {!down-chevron.md!} Select the **Stream settings**
 option from the dropdown.

4. You will be taken to the [Streams](/#streams) page;
 {!stream-settings.md!}

5. Under the **Stream settings** section you can now toggle
 **Receive audible notifications** and **Receive desktop notifications**
 for that stream.
