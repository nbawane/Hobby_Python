# Star a message
Starring messages is a good way to keep track of important messages, such as
tasks you need to go back to or documents you reference often.

{!message-actions.md!} star (<i class="icon-vector-star-empty"></i>) icon.

2. After starring a message, a filled star (<i class="icon-vector-star"></i>)
icon appears next to the timestamp of the message, confirming that the message has been
starred.

    You can click on the filled star (<i class="icon-vector-star"></i>) icon
    next to a starred message to unstar the message.

!!! tip ""
    You can narrow your view to show all starred messages by searching for
    messages with the search operator `is:starred` or clicking on the
    **Starred Messages** option on the left sidebar.
