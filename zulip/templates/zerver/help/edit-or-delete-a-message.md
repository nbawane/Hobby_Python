## Message editing time limit

Depending on your organization settings, Zulip may be configured with a time
limit within which you may edit a message (e.g. 10 minutes). As soon as that
limit has passed, the pencil (<i class="icon-vector-pencil"></i>) icon
changes to a file (<i class="icon-vector-file-text-alt"></i>) icon.

    [change the topic](/help/change-the-topic-of-a-message) of your message.

## Deleting messages

You cannot entirely delete a message. When you remove the contents of a message,
your message contents will be replaced with `(deleted)`; the original sender and
timestamp of the message will still be displayed.
