# Enable or disable Press Enter to send

Zulip supports configuring whether the **Enter** key on your keyboard
sends a message that you are composing.

By default, the `Enter` (or `Return`) key simply adds a blank line to the
message when the **Press Enter to send** checkbox is disabled. This is great if
you want to write multi-line messages that include blank lines, which is much
more common in Zulip than in other chat products.

However, if you check the **Press Enter to send** checkbox in the compose box,
Zulip sends your message when you press `Enter` (or `Return`) on your keyboard.

Whether or not the **Press Enter to send** option is enabled, pressing
`Ctrl` + `Enter` or `Tab` then `Enter` sends a message, while pressing
`Shift` + `Enter` inserts a new line in your message.
