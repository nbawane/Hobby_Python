# Share a message or conversation

A message or conversation can be shared on Zulip by creating
 a link to the conversation and sharing the link.

1. To create a link to a conversation, first locate the relevant message.

2. Hover over the message to reveal a {!down-chevron.md!}.

3. Click on the {!down-chevron.md!} and select
 the **Link to conversation** option from the dropdown.

4. Upon clicking **Link to conversation**, **topic** and **near** search
 operators will be used to create a link that narrows your messages to the
 selected message's conversation. Now, the URL in your web browser will link
 directly to the relevant message.

    !!! tip ""
        **Note:** All the messages in the relevant message's conversation will
         also be displayed when the link is navigated to.


5. The link (URL from your browser) can now be shared!
