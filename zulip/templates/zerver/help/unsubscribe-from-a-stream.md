# Unsubscribe from a stream

If you want to stop receiving messages from a particular stream in
Zulip, you can choose to unsubscribe from that stream.

There are two major ways to unsubscribe from a stream: unsubscribing
from a stream through the [Streams](/#streams) page and
unsubscribing from a stream through the stream sidebar.

## Unsubscribing from a stream through the Streams page

If you want to unsubscribe from multiple streams at once, you should unsubscribe
from streams through the [Streams](/#streams) page.

{!subscriptions.md!}
{!filter-streams.md!}

4. Click on the green checkmark to the left of the stream that you want to
unsubscribe from. Upon doing so, the green checkmark will now disappear,
confirming the success of your unsubscribing from the stream.

## Unsubscribing from a stream through the stream sidebar

If you want to quickly unsubscribe from a single stream, you can do so
through the stream sidebar.

{!stream-actions.md!}

2. Click on the {!down-chevron.md!} Select the **Unsubscribe** option from the
actions dropdown.

3. Upon selecting the **Unsubscribe** option, the selected stream will disappear
from the left sidebar, confirming the success of your unsubscribing from the
stream.
