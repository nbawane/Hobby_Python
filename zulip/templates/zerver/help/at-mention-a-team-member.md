# @-mention a team member

When having a conversation in Zulip, it is sometimes necessary to call the
attention of another member. You can @-mention (alert) other users by
mentioning them in the body of a message.

Please note that you cannot @-mention users when you edit a message, since
they may have already read the message.

!!! tip ""
    You can view any messages calling your attention by clicking on the
    **Mentions** filters in the left sidebar.

1. Compose a [new message or reply](/help/reply-to-a-message).
2. In the **Compose your message here...** field, type `@` followed by the
email address or part of the username of the user you want to @-mention.
When you begin typing an email address or username, autocomplete suggestions
will appear.

    Once you select an autocomplete suggestion, the name or email address of
the user will be replaced with  `@**name**` where `name` is the name of the
selected user.

    !!! tip ""
        If you attempt to @-mention someone who is not subscribed to the
        stream in which you're posting the message, Zulip will ask if you
        would like to subscribe the user to the stream.
