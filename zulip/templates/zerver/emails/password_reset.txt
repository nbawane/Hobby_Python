{% if attempted_realm %}
Someone (possibly you) requested a password reset email for {{ email }} on
{{ attempted_realm.uri }}, but {{ email }} does not
have an active account in {{ attempted_realm.uri }}.  However, {{ email }} does
have an active account in {{ user.realm.uri }} organization; you
can try logging in or resetting your password there.
{% else %}
Psst. Word on the street is that you forgot your password, {{ email }}.

It's all good. Follow the link below and we'll take care of the rest:

{{ protocol }}://{{ user.realm.host }}{{ url('django.contrib.auth.views.password_reset_confirm', kwargs=dict(uidb64=uid, token=token)) }}
{% endif %}
Thanks,
