# This tool contains all of the rules that we use to decide which of
# the various emoji names in emoji-map.json we should actually use in
# autocomplete and emoji pickers.  You can't do all of them, because
# otherwise there will be a ton of duplicates alphabetically next to
# each other, which is confusing and looks bad (e.g. `angry` and
# `angry_face` or `ab` and `ab_button` will always sort next to each
# other, and you really want to just pick one).  See docs/emoji.md for
# details on how this system works.
