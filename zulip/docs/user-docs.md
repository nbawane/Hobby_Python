# General user guide documentation

Our goal is for Zulip to have complete, high-quality user-appealing
documentation about use Zulip's features and perform certain tasks, such as
setting up an organization. This system is designed to make writing and
maintaining such documentation highly efficient.

## Editing and testing

The user documentation is available under `/help/` on any Zulip server;
(e.g. <https://chat.zulip.org/help/> or `http://localhost:9991/help/` in
the Zulip development environment). The user documentation is not hosted on
ReadTheDocs, since Zulip supports running a server completely disconnected
from the Internet, and we'd like the documentation to be available in that
environment.

 The source for this user documentation is the Markdown files under
`templates/zerver/help/` in the
[main Zulip server repository](https://github.com/zulip/zulip). The file
`foo.md` is automatically rendered by the `render_markdown_path` function in
`zerver/templatetags/app_filters.py` when the user accesses a URL of the
form `/help/foo`; with special cases for `/help/` going to `index.md` and
`/help/unknown_article` going to `missing.md` (with a 404 response). Images
are usually linked from `static/images/help/`.

This means that you can contribute to the Zulip user documentation by just
adding to or editing the collection of markdown files under
`templates/zerver/help`.  If you have the Zulip development environment
setup, you simply need to reload your browser on
`http://localhost:9991/help/foo` to see the latest version of `foo.md`
rendered.

## Writing documentation

Writing documentation is a different form of writing than most people have
experience with.

When you write user-appealing documentation, keep in mind that most users
don't care about how the underlying code works; they simply want to know
how a feature works or how they can do something.

Think of writing user documentation as writing a recipe; you're trying to
direct your readers how to cook a dish while introducing them to the dish
itself, yet you shouldn't go into detail about the scientific processes that
allow you to cook your dish.

By keeping these thoughts in mind, you'll be able to write better
user guide documentation.

### Title

The title of your documentation should be a brief summary of your
documentation. Your title should be formatted as a heading by prepending
your title with a `#`.

The title of your documentation needs to be included under a fitting section
in `templates/zerver/help/index.md` so users can access it from the user
documentation index.

### Introduction

By writing a brief introduction of what you will be discussing in your
documentation, users will gain a better understanding of your document. For
example, if you are writing about a feature, you could describe what the
feature allows users to do. Your introduction should be no longer than two
paragraphs.

### Directions

If you are guiding a user on how to perform a certain task in Zulip, it is
best to explain the process through a series of numbered steps. Your
documentation's goal is to direct users on how to do something so that they
achieve their goals. Thus, steps should be as detailed yet concise as
possible.

For example, if you tried to explain copying and pasting text, you could
describe it in the following steps:

```
1. Highlight the text you want to copy.

2. Press CTRL+C to copy the highlighted text.

3. Move your cursor to the location where you want to paste the text.

4. Press CTRL+V to paste the copied text.
```

You can continue steps with additional notes or instructions by breaking the
line and indenting the next line, which is especially useful for including
images within a single step.

```
1. Do something.

    You can also do this.
```

A general tip for breaking up a process is whenever a user interacts with
the Zulip UI (e.g.: click a button, refresh the page), a new step should be
created.

### Sections

If you are documenting multiple processes in your documentation, such as how
to perform a task by using several different features, you should
differentiate the processes by dividing them into sections using headings.
Like the title, your section headings should give a brief description of the
processes you describe.

All subsequent subsections should be appended with an increasing number of
`#`'s to make the headings smaller.

```
# Title

## Section 1

### Subsection 1

### Subsection 2

## Section 2

### Subsection 1
```

Always leave a blank line on either side of a section heading.

### User interface

When you refer to the features in the Zulip UI, you should **bold** the
feature's name followed by the feature itself (e.g. **Settings** page,
**Change password** button, **Email** field). No quotation marks should be
used.

Keep in mind that the UI may change — don’t describe it in more detail than
is needed. **Never identify or refer to a button by its color.**

## Features

Zulip's Markdown processor allows you to include several special features in
your documentation to help improve its readibility:

* Since raw HTML is supported in Markdown, you can include arbitrary
HTML/CSS in your documentation as needed.
* Code blocks allow you to highlight syntax, similar to Zulip's own markdown.
* Anchor tags can be used to link to headers in other documents.
* [Images](#images) of Zulip UI can be added to documentation.
* Inline [icons](#icons) used to refer to features in the Zulip UI.
* You can utilize [macros](#macros) to limit repeated content in the
documentation.
* You can create special highlight warning blocks using
[tips and warnings](#tips-and-warnings).

### Images

Images and screenshots should be included in user documentation only
if it will help guide the user in how to do something (e.g. if the
image will make it much clearer which element on the page the user
should interact with).  For instance, an image of an element should
not be included if the element the user needs to interact with is the
only thing on the page, but images can be included to show the end
result of an interaction with the UI.

Using too many screenshots creates maintainability problems (we have
to update them every time the UI is changed) and also can make the
instructions for something simple look long and complicated.

When taking screenshots, the image should never include the whole
Zulip browser window in a screenshot; instead, it should only show
relevant parts of the app.  In addition, the screenshot should always
come *after* the text that describes it, never before.

Images are often formatted as continuations of steps and must be indented on
a new line to be formatted this way.

### Icons

You can refer to features in the Zulip UI by referencing their names and
their [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io) (version 4.7.0) text icons within
parentheses. The source for the text icons is located in
`static/third/thirdparty-fonts.css`. **Note:** It is strongly recommended to use
the new base class `fa` instead of the older base class `icon-vector` when
specifying icons. In future we will be removing support for the icons with base
class `icon-vector`.

* cog (<i class="fa fa-cog"></i>) icon — `cog (<i
class="fa fa-cog"></i>) icon`
* down chevron (<i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i>) icon —
`down chevron (<i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i>) icon`
* eye (<i class="fa fa-eye"></i>) icon — `eye (<i
class="fa fa-eye"></i>) icon`
* file (<i class="fa fa-file-text-o"></i>) icon — `file (<i
class="fa fa-file-text-o"></i>) icon`
* filled star (<i class="fa fa-star"></i>) icon —
`filled star (<i class="fa fa-star"></i>) icon`
* formatting (<i class="fa fa-font"></i>) icon —
`formatting (<i class="fa fa-font"></i>) icon`
* menu (<i class="fa fa-bars"></i>) icon — `menu (<i
class="fa fa-bars"></i>) icon`
* overflow ( <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-v"></i> ) icon —
`overflow ( <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-v"></i> ) icon`
* paperclip (<i class="fa fa-paperclip"></i>) icon —

* pencil and paper (<i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o"></i>) icon —
`pencil and paper (<i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o"></i>) icon`
* plus (<i class="fa fa-plus"></i>) icon —
`plus (<i class="fa fa-plus"></i>) icon`
* smiley face (<i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>) icon —
`smiley face (<i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>) icon`
* star (<i class="fa fa-star-o"></i>) icon —
`star (<i class="fa fa-star-o"></i>) icon`
* trash (<i class="fa fa-trash-o"></i>) icon —
`trash (<i class="fa fa-trash-o"></i>) icon`
* x (<i class="fa fa-times"></i>) icon —
`x (<i class="fa fa-times"></i>) icon`

### Macros

**Macros** are elements in the format of `{!macro.md!}` that insert common
phrases and steps at the location of the macros. Macros help eliminate
repeated content in our documentation.

The source for macros is the Markdown files under
`templates/zerver/help/include` in the
[main Zulip server repository](https://github.com/zulip/zulip). If you find
multiple instances of particular content in the documentation, you can
always create a new macro by adding a new file to that folder.

encounter while following the instructions, or point to an option for power
users.

```
!!! tip ""
    If you've forgotten your password, see the
    [Change your password](/help/change-your-password) page for
    instructions on how to reset it.
```

A **warning** is a note on what happens when there is some kind of problem.
Tips are more common than warnings.

```
!!! warn ""
    **Note:** If you attempt to input a nonexistent stream name, an error
    message will appear.
```

All tips/warnings should appear inside tip/warning blocks. There should be
only one tip/warning inside each block.They usually be formatted as a
continuation of a numbered step.

## Documentation template

Here is a template for writing user documentation that follows the
guidelines listed in this document. It demonstrates the proper formatting of
several features discussed above.

You can always look at previously-written documentation in the
`templates/zerver/help` folder as a reference for writing your
documentation.

```
# Title of documentation

This paragraph briefly summarizes the documentation. Please remember to
replace this paragraph with an appropriate description of the documentation.

## Writing documentation as a series of steps

1. This is the first step of the documentation.

    ![First step](/static/images/help/image1.png)

2. This is the second step of the documentation.

    Here's an additional note about the second step. Click on the star (<i
    class="fa fa-star-half-o"></i>) icon to learn more about it.

3. This is the third step of the documentation.

    !!! tip ""
        You can always add more steps to your documentation!

## Writing documentation to introduce a feature

If necessary, you can add another section to your documentation. Sections
can be used to differentiate different methods of performing a task or
describing a related task.

![Feature](/static/images/help/feature.png)

You can also conclude your documentation with some final notes.

!!! warn ""
    **Note:** This is only a documentation template; you can always deviate
    **from this template to suit your documentation needs.
```
