Zulip supports integration with Pivotal Tracker and can notify
you of changes to the stories in your Pivotal Tracker project.

{!create-bot-construct-url.md!}

Next, in the **Settings** page for your project, choose the
**Integrations** tab. Scroll down to the **Activity Web Hook**
section, and enter the URL created above.

Choose version 5 of the API. Zulip supports both version 3 and
version 5, but version 5 contains more information that lets
Zulip format more useful messages.
