    <em>
        If you are running JIRA version 5.2 or greater, or if you are
        using the hosted JIRA provided by Atlassian, you can use the built-in
        web-hook support to connect to Zulip &mdash; read on. For older,
        self-hosted JIRA installs, you can use our <a href="#jira-plugin">JIRA Plugin</a>.
    </em>
</p>

<p>
    First, create the stream you'd like to use for JIRA notifications, and
    subscribe all interested parties to this stream. We recommend the
    name <code>jira</code>.
</p>

<p>
    In your JIRA administration control panel, go to the Webhooks page. If you are using the OnDemand
    hosted JIRA, follow the instructions
    <a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/jiradev/jira-apis/webhooks#Webhooks-jiraadmin">
        on the Atlassian wiki
    </a>
    for locating the Webhook UI.
</p>
<p>Give your new web hook a name, and for the URL provide the following:</p>
<p>
    <code>{{ external_api_uri_subdomain }}/v1/external/jira?api_key=abcdefgh&amp;stream=jira</code>
</p>

<p>
    where <code>api_key</code> is the API key of your Zulip bot,
    and <code>stream</code> is the stream name you want the
    notifications sent to.
</p>

<p>
    Next, go back to Zulip and set up a stream called "jira," if it does not already exist.
    (If you prefer your JIRA notifications to go to a stream other than "jira," then change the URL above to match
    it.)
</p>

<p>
    <b>Congratulations! You're done!</b><br/>
    Updates from JIRA will be sent to the Zulip stream you specified in the JIRA web-hook.
