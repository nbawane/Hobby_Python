<p>See your Travis CI build notifications in Zulip!</p>

<p>
    First, create the stream you'd like to use for notifications, and subscribe
    all interested parties to this stream. We recommend the name <code>travis</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Next, set up a bot for the integration. You'll need the bot's API key
    to construct a URL for Travis CI.
</p>


<p>
    Finally, set up a webhook in your <code>.travis.yml</code> file:
</p>

<pre>
notifications:
webhooks:
- {{ external_api_uri_subdomain }}/v1/external/travis?stream=travis&amp;topic=build-status&amp;api_key=abcdefgh
</pre>

<p>
    By default, pull request events are ignored since most people
    don't want notifications for new pushes to pull requests.  To
    enable notifications for pull request builds, just
    add<code>&ignore_pull_requests=false</code> at the end of the url.
</p>

<p><b>
    Congratulations! You're done!</b><br/> When a code build occurs,
    you're receive a notification on the specified stream and topic.
</p>
