<p>Zulip supports both SVN and Git notifications from Beanstalk.</p>

<p>
    First, create the stream <code>commits</code> and subscribe all
    interested parties to this stream.
</p>

<p>
    Next, in the Beanstalk web application, go to the Setup page and choose the Integrations tab.
    Choose the <code>Webhooks</code> integration from the list presented.
    Make sure to replace the <code>@</code> in the
    bot's email address with <code>%40</code>,
    as Beanstalk's website will incorrectly refuse to parse a username containing a <code>@</code>.
</p>

<p>
    In the URL field, enter
    <code>{{ external_uri_scheme }}bot_email:bot_api_key@{{ external_api_path_subdomain }}/v1/external/beanstalk</code>:
</p>
<p>
    You can also limit the Git notifications you receive to specific
    branches by specifying them in a comma-separated list at the end
    of the URL, like so:
</p>
<p><code>{{ external_uri_scheme }}bot_email:bot_api_key@{{ external_api_path_subdomain }}/v1/external/beanstalk?branches=master,development</code></p>

<p>
    <b>Congratulations! You're done!</b><br/> Whenever you do a
    deployment, you'll get an automated notification that looks like
    this:
