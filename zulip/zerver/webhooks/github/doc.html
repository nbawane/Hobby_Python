<p>
    This webhook bases on deprecated concept that is
    <a href="https://github.com/github/github-services">GitHub Services</a>
</p>

<p>
    First, create the stream you'd like to use for GitHub notifications,
    and subscribe all interested parties to this stream. The integration will
    use the default stream <code>commits</code> if no stream is supplied in
    the hook; you still need to create the stream even if you are using this
    default.
</p>

<p>Next, go to your repository page and click <b>"Settings"</b>:</p>

<p>From there, select <b>"Webhooks &amp; Services"</b>:</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/integrations/github/002.png"/></p>

<p>To find the Zulip hook, you have to click on <b>Configure services</b>.</p>

<p>
    Select <b>"Zulip"</b> from the list of service hooks. Fill in
    the API key and email address for your bot and check
    the <b>"active"</b> checkbox. Specify
    <code>{{ external_api_uri_subdomain }}/v1/external/github</code> as the <b>"Alternative
    endpoint"</b>. You can optionally supply the Zulip stream (the
    default is <code>commits</code>) and restrict Zulip
    notifications to a specified set of branches.
</p>

<p>
    Further configuration is possible. By default, commits traffic (pushes, commit comments),
    GitHub issues traffic, and pull requests are enabled. You can exclude certain types of traffic
    via the checkboxes. If you want commit traffic, issue traffic, and pull requests to go to
    different places, you can use the <b>Commit Stream</b> and <b>Issue Stream</b> overrides;
    otherwise, it is safe to leave these fields blank and just have it default to the <b>Stream</b>
    setting.
</p>

<p>
    Click the <b>"Update settings"</b> button to complete the
    configuration:

    <b>Congratulations! You're done!</b><br/> When team members push to
    your repository, you'll get a Zulip notification that looks like this:
