<p>
    See your Splunk Search alerts in Zulip!
</p>
<p>
    First, create the stream you'd like to use for Splunk notifications,
    and subscribe all interested parties to this stream. We recommend the
    stream name <code>splunk</code>, although you may choose another stream
    if you prefer.
</p>

<p>
    Next, in the Splunk search app, execute the search you'd like to alert on
    and then save it as an alert:
</p>

<p>
   <img src="/static/images/integrations/splunk/splunk_save_as_alert.png"/>
</p>

<p>
    Name and configure your search in the "Settings" and "Trigger Conditions"
    sections of the "Save As Alert" dialog box. In the "Trigger Actions" section,
    click "Add Actions" and select "Webhook" to add a webhook action. Put the
    Zulip Splunk webhook URL and your API key in the "URL" field, along with
    your desired stream and (optional) topic name. If you do not specify a stream,
    your messages will use the default stream `splunk`. If you do not specify a topic,
    the name of the search is used (truncated to fit if needed.)
</p>

<p>
   Example:
<code>{{ external_api_uri_subdomain }}/v1/external/splunk?api_key=abcde&stream=splunk&topic=alerts</code>
</p>

<p>
   When you are done, it should look like this:
</p>

<p>
<img src="/static/images/integrations/splunk/splunk_configure_url.png"/>
</p>

<p>
   Click Save to save the alert. You can create as many searches with alert
   actions as you like, with whatever stream and topic you choose. Update your
   webhook URL as appropriate for each one, and make sure the stream exists.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Congratulations! You're done!</b><br/> When your search triggers an
    alert, you'll see a notification like this:
</p>

<p>
<img class="screenshot" src="/static/images/integrations/splunk/splunk_message.png"/>
</p>
