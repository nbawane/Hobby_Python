    Zulip supports integration with Pingdom and can notify you of
    uptime status changes from your Pingdom dashboard.
</p>

<p>
    First, create the stream you'd like to use for Pingdom notifications,
    and subscribe all interested parties to this stream. We
    recommend the name <code>pingdom</code>.
</p>

<p><code>{{ external_api_uri_subdomain }}/v1/external/pingdom?api_key=abcdefgh&amp;stream=pingdom</code></p>

<p>
    where <code>api_key</code> is the API key of your Zulip bot,
    and <code>stream</code> is the stream name you want the
    notifications sent to.
</p>

<p>Next, under following url: </p>
<p><code>https://my.pingdom.com/reports/integration/settings</code></p>
<p>create your integration by clicking on <code>Add Integration</code> button and filling form as following:</p>

<p>
    Last, during creating or editing your check, scroll down to <code>Connect Integrations</code>
    section and ensure your integration is checked
</p>

<p>
    <b>Congratulations! You're done!</b><br/> Example Zulip notification
    looks like this:
