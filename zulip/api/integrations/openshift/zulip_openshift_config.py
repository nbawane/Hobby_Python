# deployment_notice_destination() lets you customize where deployment notices
# are sent to with the full power of a Python function.
#
# It takes the following arguments:
# * branch = the name of the branch where the deployed commit was
#            pushed to
#
# Returns a dictionary encoding the stream and subject to send the
# notification to (or None to send no notification).
#
# The default code below will send every commit pushed to "master" to
# * stream "deployments"
# * topic "master"
# And similarly for branch "test-post-receive" (for use when testing).

    # Return None for cases where you don't want a notice sent
    return None

# Modify this function to change how deployments are displayed
#
# It takes the following arguments:
# * app_name  = the name of the app being deployed
# * url       = the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) where the app
#                can be found
# * branch    = the name of the branch where the deployed commit was
#                pushed to
# * commit_id = hash of the commit that triggered the deployment
# * dep_id    = deployment id
# * dep_time  = deployment timestamp
