    This plugin facilitates creating follow-up tasks when
    you are using Zulip to conduct a virtual meeting.  It
    looks for messages starting with '@mention-bot'.

    In this example, we write follow up items to a special
    Zulip stream called "followup," but this code could
    be adapted to write follow up items to some kind of
    external issue tracker as well.

            This plugin will allow users to flag messages
            as being follow-up items.  Users should preface
            messages with "@mention-bot".

            Before running this, make sure to create a stream
            called "followup" that your API user can send to.
